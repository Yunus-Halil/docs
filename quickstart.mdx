## Get started in three steps

### Step 1: Project Setup

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create a Project" icon="folder">
    On the sidebar to the left, click the 'Project' dropdown and then create a new project.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Attach address" icon="people-roof">
    1. While Creating a Project, input your client's address while naming the project in the input field below it.
    2. You can always change your client's address later.
    3. Sometimes the address to square footage doesn't work do to factors such as roof blockage due to trees. If it doesn't work, only the address will be attached to the client folder.

    <Tip>
      The square footage estimate is over 90% accurate
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Upload and Annotate Drone Images

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="In the sidebar, navigate to the Upload section" icon="upload">
    We support**batch uploads** . Select your drone images (with metadata), and start the annotation process
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Annotate your drone images" icon="paintbrush-pencil">
    To annotate, you have a variety of options.

    1. If you click the AI scan, our AI will detect damage spots, with a customizable slider to adjust confidence (How much damage the AI will pick up)
    2. The Rectangle tool allows for holding and dragging to create boxes
    3. The Polygon tool allows users to click in specific places, and then double-click on the closing line to create a specific shape, perfect for marking individual shingles.
    4. Clicking the select tool allows you to move and resize existing annotations, and change the type of damage, the severity, and the color on the right, in the properties section
    5. If you go to the List tab on the right, you can view your existing annotations on the image.
