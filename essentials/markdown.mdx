### Add comments for individual annotations

This is optional, but can greatly help your clients understand the damages that they are looking at

### Roof Damage Analysis and Include Repair Cost Estimates Checkboxes

The Roof Damage Analysis displays a bar with the percentage of the roof damaged. The include repair cost adds the calculated repair cost based on your annotations. Both of these are optional but can help your client see the bigger picture of their roof.

### Click Generate Analysis Report

If you're done commenting and adding in the Report Options, then simply **click the Generate Analysis Report.** After a couple of seconds you should see that it saves into your system as a PDF.
